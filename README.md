## Introduction
This project explores a dataset comprising detailed information on restaurants in Boston. The dataset includes attributes such as the restaurant's name, Yelp page URL, review count, categories, average rating, sample review text, neighborhood, latitude, and longitude.

## Data and Exploration Needs
Our dataset allows for an in-depth exploration of Boston's dining scene, catering to users with varied dining preferences:

### Key Exploration Needs:
- **Cuisine and Food Type**: Users can filter restaurants based on specific cuisines or food types like Italian or Seafood.
- **Quality**: Filtering by Yelp ratings helps focus on highly recommended establishments.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Users can explore dining options within specific neighborhoods of Boston.
- **Interactive Elements**: Tooltips or pop-ups on the map provide quick insights, including the restaurant's name, rating, and review count.

## Storyboards and Justifications
The interaction design begins with an expansive map view of Boston, enabling various user interactions:

### Key Interactions:
- **Cuisine and Food Type Filters**: Users can narrow down options to match their tastes.
- **Rating Filter**: Highlights top-rated restaurants to ensure quality dining experiences.
- **Distance Filter**: Allows finding restaurants within a certain radius, enhancing convenience.
- **Interactive Map Features**: Users can zoom into neighborhoods, enhancing the exploration experience.

## Description of Final Interactive Visualization
The final product is a dynamic, map-based tool designed for exploring Boston's restaurant scene:

### Features:
- **Intuitive Filtering Options**: Users can select restaurants based on cuisine, venue type, and Yelp ratings.
- **Geographical Searches**: An interactive map supports searches by neighborhood through pan and zoom features.

## Development Process
The development began with drafting simple sketches and evolved into a detailed interactive map and side panel filters:

### Initial Ideas and Adjustments:
- **Category Filter**: Initially thought to be in hyperbolic space, simplified to clickable icons due to time constraints.
- **Rating Filter**: Planned as an interactive SVG of stars, simplified to static stars.
- **Distance Filter**: Intended as a grey overlay, simplified to an interactive slider due to time constraints.
- **Search Bar and Interactive Pop-ups**: Planned but not implemented due to time limits.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates effective collaboration and technical development in creating an interactive tool for exploring restaurant data. It highlights the importance of user-centered design in data visualization.
